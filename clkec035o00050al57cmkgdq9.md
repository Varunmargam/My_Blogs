# üìçUsers & Groups

üìùNote: Any operations on users and groups can only be done by the root user, normal users will have to use #sudo before every command to perform operations on users and groups.üñä

## ‚úîUsers

In Linux, a user is similar to a user account in Windows. Each user has a unique identity to which they can log in and perform various operations on the system. Both Linux and Windows support multiple user accounts users and allows each user to give a separate work environment. In Linux, each user gets a separate file structure and a work environment to perform their operations. By file structure, I mean this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690028708950/ef5b6cde-2384-4edc-8f01-9a4d5ca0e1ab.png align="center")

As shown above every user will have a file structure like this. All the existing users in the system are stored in `/etc/passwd` file with their `<username>`. You can see it by doing `#cat /etc/passwd`. And all the user's account passwords are stored in `/etc/shadow` file in an encrypted format.

### üìçLet's explore some user management commands:

1. `#useradd <username>`: Used to add a new user to the system. For a normal user use `sudo`.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690029325286/6b433fb1-5342-4ca6-b23c-530f9f905763.png align="center")
    
    In the above image, you can see that the user has been added successfully to the system. It can also be seen in the `/etc/passwd` file. But as you can see there is no directory of the user created inside the home directory. For that, we use the option `-m`:
    
    * `#useradd -m <username>`: This will add a user as well as create a directory for the user inside the home directory.
        
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690030329553/a01ae170-b49a-4ebc-977b-681e4da8df1a.png align="center")
    
2. `#passwd <username>`: It is used to change a user's password so that, it can be used to log in to that user's account.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690030702191/628088fb-fc69-4563-a824-47522ddf644c.png align="center")
    
    Normal users can only change their password, while the super-user can change the password of any user.
    
3. `#su <username>`: It is used to switch to the user whose `<username>` is specified.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690031352935/85f0a869-3c8e-4837-9b04-7aec8f1ab605.png align="center")
    
    As I am a normal user it is asking for the password. After typing the password we set previously, we logged in to a `varun` user account. If I had tried to switch user as a root user it would have not asked for a password.
    
4. `#exit` or Press the "Ctrl + d" key: It is used to exit from a user's account.
    
5. `#userdel <username>`: Used to delete a user account. Use '`sudo`' for a normal user.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690031943813/4f9da0da-e46f-4403-8c62-73302c20dfd8.png align="center")
    
    As you can see, the user has been removed and it is also deleted from the `/etc/passwd` file. But the user `varun` directory inside the `/home` directory still exists. To remove that we use the option `-r`:
    
    * `#userdel -r <username>`: Used to delete a user account as well as its home directory.
        
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690032232315/dd1689b2-3d37-4158-834e-3fd8f5e4e909.png align="center")
    
6. `#usermod`: It is used to modify the user account.
    
    * `-l (--login)`
        
        `#usermod -l <new_username> <username>`: It will change the user's name from `<username>` to `<new_username>`.
        
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690032843243/c804e4b2-f354-48e6-9d1f-0c513fd4806c.png align="center")
    
    As you can see, the username `varun` changed to `lokesh`. The second `varun` highlighted in red in the same line is the group name.
    

## ‚úîGroup

In Linux, a group is a collection of user accounts. Whenever we create a new user in Linux it by default creates a group with the same name as the user.

All the existing groups in the system are stored in /etc/group file with &lt;groupname&gt;. You can see it by doing `#cat /etc/group`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690035292016/97a38355-4efe-4871-b8ec-f93480eda2a7.png align="center")

I used the tail command to print the last 1 line because there were many groups. `varun` here is the group name, `x` is the password, and `1001` is the group id (GID).

### üìçLet's explore some Group management commands:

1. `#groupadd <group_name>`: Creates a new group with the name `<group_name>`.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690035632744/9abc9ee2-9e5b-4fd5-a754-41ee3f609d8b.png align="center")
    
    A group `devops` was created with the group id (GID) `1002`.
    
2. `groupmod`
    
    * `-n (name)`: The name of the group will change.
        
        `#groupmod -n <new_name> <old_name>`: The group name will change from `<old_name>` to `<new_name>`.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690036513845/02f3dd89-56b2-44f2-a218-d1ded4f409ea.png align="center")
        
    * `--gid or --g/-g`: The group id (GID) will change.
        
        `#groupmod --gid <newGID> <group_name>`: It will change GID of the group `<group_name>` to `<newGID>`.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690037183574/4a5a43ac-d196-4d95-bf5f-c7222a7a4c83.png align="center")
        
3. `#groupdel <group_name>`: It deleted the group specified.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690036089689/8038434f-e255-475d-ad9a-87c4dcdcf506.png align="center")
    
    A group named `devops` was deleted.
    
4. `#gpasswd`: This command is used to administer `/etc/group`, and `/etc/gshadow`
    
    * `-a`: It is used to add a user.
        
        `#gpasswd -a <username> <groupname>`: It will add user `<username>` in the group `<groupname>`.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690038167061/52a20cd0-eacd-4d73-89b8-7a3b7c883210.png align="center")
        
    * `-M`: It is used to add multiple users at a time.
        
        `#gpasswd -M <username1>,<username2>,<username3> <group_name>`: It will add users `<username1>,<username2>,<username3>` in the group `<group_name>`.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690038561110/ef8acc0a-cbc0-4a81-b796-3ab8b6a03b65.png align="center")
        
        As you can see, `aryan`, and `lokesh` users have also been added to the `devops` group.
        
    * `-d (delete)`: It will remove the user from the named group.
        
        `#gpasswd -d <username> <group_name>`: It will remove the user `<username>` from the group `<group_name>`.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690038907262/6cf07137-83f2-4bae-ad67-0ef47f73f22e.png align="center")
        
5. `#groups <user_name>`: Shows all the groups the user `<user_name>` is a part of.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690039408197/924f14ca-7088-4a84-9e6d-ab0ae7056e65.png align="center")
    
6. `#usermod`: It is used to modify the user account.
    
    * `-aG (append group)`: It will append the user to the group.
        
        `#usermod -aG <group_name> <username>`: It will add the user `<username>` to the group `<group_name>`
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690039617246/b23c66cf-8583-425f-89fd-da59e55e51ae.png align="center")
        
        *Note: Make sure to use* `-a` *option because, if you only use the* `-G` *option will override the current group the user is a part of.*

# üìçFile Permissions & ownership

One of the many features that set Linux apart from other OS is that multiple users in Linux can access the same system simultaneously. To achieve this there is a need for a method to protect the users from each other. This is the reason file permissions were needed.

## ‚úîPermission classes:

There are 3 permission classes:

1. User (the user who created the file)
    
2. Group
    
3. Others (other users)
    

To know which user created a file we use the command #ls -l &lt;filename&gt;

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690040141144/53877411-0b4b-4f0b-a125-d907a4f1e3f5.png align="center")

In the above image, the first block `drwxrwxr-x` tells us permissions given to the user, group, and others:

* r - Read, w - Write, x - Execute
    
* The first character `d` represents the file type. Here, the file type is a directory.
    
* The next 3 characters `rwx` represents the permissions assigned to the user who created the file.
    
* The next 3 characters `rwx` represents the permissions assigned to the group.
    
* The next 3 characters `r-x` represents the permissions assigned to other users.
    

The second block represents the number of hard links, in this case `2`.

The third block represents the user who owns the file (&lt;user\_name&gt;). Here, it is `ubuntu` user.

The fourth block represents the group that owns the file(&lt;group\_name&gt;). Here it is `ubuntu` group.

The fifth block represents the file size. Here it is `4096 (in bytes)`.

The sixth block represents the date of creation.

At last, the name of the file, in this case, is `devops`.

## ‚úîChanging permissions

`#chmod` command is used to change the permissions given to the users, group, and others.

There are 2 ways to change permissions:

1. Non-numeric way
    
2. Numeric way
    

### üìçNon-numeric way

Here, the users are denoted by u, a group is denoted by g, and others are denoted by o.

To give permissions we use + and to remove permission we use -

Let's take an example to understand it better:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690040736543/0fc7527a-6678-40f6-b986-e4bff37033fb.png align="center")

The above `test.txt` file has permissions `rw-rw-r--`.

The user has read(r), and write(w) permission, to add execute(x) permission we will do `u+x`:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690040945424/d5153298-7a1b-405a-9a71-bda608fc7aa3.png align="center")

As you can see the user's permission changed from `rw-` to `rwx`.

To remove the permission we will use (-):

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690041105941/e4f356b4-a2cb-4fe3-b7ed-6751c60495be.png align="center")

As you can see, the user permissions changed from `rwx` to `r-x`.

Similarly, you do change permissions to the group(g) and to others(o).

### üìçNumeric way

An example of giving permission using a numerical way:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690041273208/704121e2-1544-4441-a55e-e6cb9823a35d.png align="center")

In the above image, the 3-digit number each digit represents the permissions given to the user, group, and others respectively. In the above example, 7 is the permission for the user, 7 is for the group, and 7 is for other users.

Here, all the 3 permissions are assigned a number:

read (r) - 4, write (w) - 2, execute (x) - 1

If I want to give read(4), write(2), and execute(1) permission then we will add the numbers each is assigned to i.e. 4+2+1 = 7. Therefore, 7 represents all the permissions.

If I want to give read(4) and execute(1) permission then it will be 4+1 = 5.

If I want to give no permission it will be 0.

If I want to give only write(2) permission then it will be 2.

Example 1:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690041446602/b635a795-9def-4d40-886a-8003bc186b4c.png align="center")

In the above example, we know 7 means all the permissions. Therefore, 777 means all the permissions are given to the user, group, and others respectively.

Example 2:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690041616499/01ba0060-dd07-4ff7-948e-5b77be7cf400.png align="center")

Think for yourself what permissions are given and then check the answer.ü§î

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Ans</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">The user is given permission 7 which means <code>4+2+1</code> i.e. read(r), write(w), and execute(e). The group is given permission 6 which means <code>4+2</code> i.e. read(r), and write(w). The group is given permission <code>4</code> which means only read(r).</div></details>

## ‚úîChanging ownership of the file

üìùImportant: Only a root user can change the owner of the file. Only the root or the owner can change a file's group.

`#chown` command is used to change the ownership of a file.

`#chown <username> <file/directory>`: The user `<username>` ownership of the file `<file/directory>`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690042441166/f423b5ee-c929-42f2-a54a-76c44d6f15a3.png align="center")

# üìçFiltering (grep, find, awk, & sed)

Suppose you are in a scenario where you have to find a single word, or a particular column from a large file and a DevOps engineer faces a lot of scenarios like these. For such scenarios, we use Filtering commands.

I copied some lines of a log file from here [IBM\_logs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.2.0?topic=problems-example-log-file) and then pasted into a directory called `ibmlogs.logs` using the Vim editor.

## ‚úîgrep - global regular expression print

`#grep word <filepath>`: It finds the word from the file when given its path.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690045843093/4e265580-3747-4cf0-938d-76e62ac10ea8.png align="center")

It gave me all the lines which had `TRACE` in it.

* `-r`: With this the grep command can also find the word inside a directory.
    
    `#grep -r word <file/directorypath>`.
    
* `-i (case insensitive)`: It will find a word irrespective of its case.
    
    `#grep word <filepath>`: It will display the word even if that word is in capital letters or small.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690046209170/47baf852-a6a1-4833-9560-c5383254492a.png align="center")
    
    I typed `initialized` in the command but it also printed Initialized, which would not have been the case if we were not using `-i`.
    

## ‚úîawk

Awk itself is a programming language. It is used to trim, filter a file based on our requirements and also find a word.

Let's take an example of the `ibmlogs.log` file:

1. I want to search for `TRACE` in that file, for this, the command will be:
    

`#awk '/TRACE/' ibmlogs.log`: This will display all the lines containing `TRACE` inside `ibmlogs.log`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690047353331/52d85075-8812-41ce-aeb3-b20c8981e710.png align="center")

1. Now I want all the lines containing `TRACE` but only the 1st, 3rd, and the 6th column for this the command will be:
    
    `#awk '/TRACE/ {print $1,$3,$6}' ibmlogs.log`: This will display the 1st, 3rd, and the 6th column containing the word `TRACE`.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690047698538/39faf548-fcdb-4414-a25f-7177e1a014fb.png align="center")
    

## ‚úîsed - stream editor

It is used to search for a word in the file and replace it with the word required to be in the output.

üìùNote: It will only modify the output, there will be no change in the original file.

Syntax: `#sed 's/word_being_replaced/word_replaced_by/g' <filename_or_filepath>`

`s` - search for

`g` - is for global i.e. if a word repeats twice in a line then it will consider it, if not mentioned then it will only consider the very first occurrence of the word inside a line and will move to the next line.

Let's display the first 10 lines of the `ibmlogs.logs` file and replace the word `INFO` with `VARUN`, the command for this is:

`#sed 's/TRACE/VARUN/g' ibmlogs.log`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690048184340/a08371a0-ef29-43ed-b131-0b2c797b929b.png align="center")

All the lines containing `TRACE` is replaced by `VARUN`. I just piped `|` two commands to display only top 10 lines of a file.

*You can concatenate 2 commands using* `|` *key (above the enter button), the left command's output will be the input to the right command. More about this in my next blog.*
