# üìçLinux Terminologies

* `Boot Loader`: Program that loads the Linux OS. Eg: GRUB - Grand Unified Boot Loader. Initiates the `Kernel`. It resides in the `/` base directory `/boot`.
    
* `Kernel`: It is an interface that connects users to the hardware via shell. It runs the very first `init` process, which resides in `/sbin/init`.
    
* `Shell`: Shell is a command line interface that allows the user to communicate with the kernel. By default, Linux contains a bash shell. There are other kinds of shells like Korn shell, Z shell (zsh), Secured shell (ssh), etc.
    
* `Daemon (or services)`: In Linux Daemon is a program that runs on the background and takes care of executing all the subprocesses required for the OS to run properly. In Linux processes ending with `d` are daemon processes. Eg: the `systemd` process is executed by the init process.
    
* `Root or /`: In Linux root is the base directory where the OS resides. There is also a root directory for the root user which has all the permissions given to it.
    
* `Directory`: In Linux directory is a folder. It is a type of file.

# üìçLinux Distributions

Linux distributions are classified based on how they are packaged.

* **RPM(RedHat Package Manager) based**: RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), Centos, Oracle Linux.
    
* **Debian-based (.deb)**: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc., and many other distros.

*üìùNote: These user and group management commands can only be executed by the root user, normal users who are present in the sudoers file can execute these commands by adding sudo at the beginning of the command.*

* `userdel user`: Deletes the user.
    
* `usermod -aG group user`: Adds the user to the group.

# üìçFile permissions

`chmod <permissions> file`: Syntax of the `chmod` command used to change file permissions.

Permissions are Read - r, Write - w, Execute - x.

**There are two ways to give permissions to the file:**

1. Non-numeric
    
2. Numeric
    

### ‚úîNon-numeric way

Users/Owner - u, Groups - g, Other users - o.

* `u+`: To give permissions to the user it can be r, w, x, or rx any of the combinations you want to give.
    
* `u-`: To remove permissions from the user.
    
* Similar for the Group (g) and other users(o).
    

### ‚úîNumeric way

* Read - 4
    
* Write - 2
    
* Execute - 1
    
* To give read and write permission it is 4+2 i.e. 6.
    
* To give read and execute permission it is 4+1 i.e. 5.
    
* To give read, write, and execute permission it is 7 (4+2+1).
    
* The command `#chmod 777 file` denotes the permissions given to the owner group others.
    

## ‚úîChanging Ownership of the File

* `chown` command is used to change the owner of the file. Only the root user can change a file's owner.
    
* `chown -R new_user <file/directory>`: Changes the ownership of the file to the `new_user`. `-R` changes the ownership of the directory as well as all the files and directories inside it.
    
* `chgrp` is used to change group ownership. Only the root or the owner can change the file's group
    
* `chgrp -R new_group <file/directory>`: Changes the ownership of the file to the `new_group`.

* `grep -i word <file path>`: Searches a `word` insensitive to the word's case.
    
* `grep -v word <file path>`: Search and displays all the lines which do not contain the `word`.
    
* `grep -c word <file path>`: Displays the count of the `word` in the file.
    
* `awk '/word/' <file path>`: Searches and displays the word from the file.
    
* `awk '/word/ print{$1,$2,$3}' <file path>`: Displays only the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd field of the line containing the `word`.
    

---

# üìçPackage Management (APT)

Downloading or removing packages can only be executed by the root user.
